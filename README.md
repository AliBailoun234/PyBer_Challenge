# PyBer_Challenge

###Overview
The purpose of the project was to calculate and graph the total weekly fares for different city types (Rural, Urban, Suburban)

###Results
The Urban cities had the highest fare amongst the three different city types. The fares in urban cities relatively increased within the first four months of 2019 from around 1,650$ in January to around 2,250$ in April
The Rural cities had the lowest fare amongst the three city types. They relatively stayed the same average fare of around 250$

###Summary
There is an opportunity to expand rides specifically in the Suburban cities. 
Increase the amount of drivers or USD Dollar Fare in Rural areas.
